getSequentialMatchesInArray is a function that takes a vector array as input, and returns 
the length of the longest x-in-a-row streak, and the start index of the streak


input      outputLength     outputStartIndex
1 2 3 3    2                3
7 7 7 0    3                1
6 5 4 3    1                1

this algorithm is used to determine any win-cases for my slot machine game.
There is a driverfule 'sequentialMatchesDriver.m' to further verify functionality
